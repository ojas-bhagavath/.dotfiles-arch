# Pylance Docs

Use this skill when the answer should be grounded in current Pylance documentation instead of memory, source guesses, or stale web knowledge.

## Workflow

1. Turn the user's question into a Pylance documentation search query.
2. Call `pylanceDocuments` with `action="search"`.
3. Fetch the most relevant result with `action="fetch"`.
4. Follow important `references` by calling `pylanceDocuments` with `action="fetch"` again for each referenced document you need.
5. Answer from the fetched documentation. Say when the docs do not cover the requested behavior.

## When Docs Are Not Enough

-   Use `pylanceSettings` when the user needs the effective settings for the current workspace.
-   Use `pylanceLSP` diagnostics when the user asks about a specific Problems entry, diagnostic code, or file error.
-   Use `pylancePythonEnvironments` when the question depends on the editor-selected interpreter.

## Working Rules

-   Prefer official docs for settings, diagnostics, feature support, configuration, and troubleshooting claims.
-   Do not treat source search as official product guidance.
-   Do not read referenced doc paths directly from disk; fetch references through `pylanceDocuments` so uncached docs are retrieved correctly.
-   Include the setting name, diagnostic code, or feature name that changed the answer when reporting the result.
